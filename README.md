Processed (registered and sorted by trial type) data can be found here: 
'XXexp' structures are ChRmison-expressing mice. Data is organized as: trial repetitions x time (30 fps) x Cell
'CL' is continuous light and 'Pulsed' is 33 Hz light stimulation.
'XXCtrl' structures are light control experiments, i.e., mice that do not express ChRimson but same stimulation protocol was applied.

'XX_allTrials' structrues are the same as the respective 'XXexp' structures but data is organized by sessions.

data are in dF/F
